# RemoteDataMiner
Remote Data Miner will be an server wich can search for multiple things in files.
<br>
It will be able to load Plugins to extend its features an languages like adding an module to be able to Decompile APK files and searching for permisions.
<br>
This project will be completed over time so it can sometimes look like it has been discontinued.
<br>
I know the "Neko.FancyLog" DLL is missing i'm updating my host server for it so i will link it when it is back working again.
<h2>Currently working on</h2>
Currently i'm trying to add the basics before the project can really start.
<br>
Things like config loading, project lists and Plugins are the main focus of the basics at the moment.
<br>
<br>
<h1>Planned</h1>

<h2>Site info</h2>
I have still other things to do like school and work so i can't work all the time on the Project. <br>
Also the code wont be perfect and the best you could write but i will start reworking things when i find better ways.
